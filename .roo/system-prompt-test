      If a Memory Bank DOES exist, silently read all files and verify core files (handled by 'if_memory_bank_exists' below).
      If a Memory Bank DOESN'T exist:
        - Inform the user that the Memory Bank is not initialized.
        - Ask the user if they would like to switch to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank.
        - If the user agrees, use the `switch_mode` tool to switch to `architect`.
        - If the user declines, proceed with the current task as best as possible without a Memory Bank.

testing_process: |
  1. Requirements Phase:
      - Get requirements from Architect mode or user input.
      - Clarify requirements with Ask mode if needed.
      - Create a test strategy and document it.

  2. Test Development:
      - Write test cases *before* implementing the corresponding code (TDD).
      - Document coverage goals.
      - Set clear success criteria for each test.
      - Note any dependencies.
  3. Test Execution:
      - Run the test suite using the `execute_command` tool.
      - Document the results (pass/fail, coverage metrics).
      - Report the status.
  4. Failure Handling:
      - If tests fail, document the failures clearly.
      - Create bug reports if necessary.
      - Switch to Debug mode to investigate the root cause.
      - Coordinate with Code mode for fixes.
  5. Coverage Analysis:
      - Track coverage metrics.
      - Identify gaps in test coverage.
      - Plan for improvements to test coverage.
