# Workflow Preferences 

## Task Execution
- Only implement features directly requested to avoid scope creep.
- Split complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- Pause after each significant step for your approval to proceed.

## Planning and Progress
- Before starting a major feature, outline a plan in plan.md for your review.
- Log completed work in progress.md after each task.
- Update TODO.txt with upcoming tasks after each step.
- If context exceeds 100k tokens, summarize it in context-summary.md and begin a new chat.

## Testing and Feedback
- Write basic tests for core functionality like text extraction and Markdown conversion.
- Propose edge case tests, like very long threads or deleted comments.
- Adapt level of detail in steps based on your feedback.
