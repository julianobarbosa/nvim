## Current Focus
- Configuring keyboard shortcuts for cycling through previous and next buffers using `<Shift>+H>` and `<Shift>+P>` respectively.

## Recent Changes
- Added keybindings in `lua/custom/plugins/keymaps.lua`:
  - `<Shift>+H`: Cycle through previous buffers.
  - `<Shift>+P`: Cycle through next buffers.

## Next Steps
- Test the new keybindings to ensure they work as expected.
