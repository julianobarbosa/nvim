# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Debugging infrastructure improvements
- DAP configuration optimization
- Performance monitoring integration

## Recent Changes
1. Restructured DAP plugin configuration
   - Added proper plugin dependencies
   - Fixed initialization order
   - Improved error handling

2. Enhanced debugging capabilities
   - Added performance monitoring
   - Integrated framework-specific configs
   - Optimized UI layout

3. Added performance features
   - Profile current file option
   - Import time tracking
   - Library code debugging
   - Auto UI configuration

## Next Steps
1. Test framework-specific configurations
2. Verify performance monitoring
3. Document new debugging commands
4. Create usage examples

## Active Decisions
- Using separate configurations for different Python frameworks
- Enabling library code debugging by default
- Auto-opening debug UI on events
- Including performance metrics in debug layout
