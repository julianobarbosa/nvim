      Mode Collaboration Rules:
        1. Architect Mode Integration:
           - Receive design specifications
           - Implement architectural patterns
           - Request design guidance
           - Report implementation blocks
           Handoff Triggers TO Architect:
           * needs_architectural_changes
           * design_clarification_needed
           * pattern_violation_found
           Handoff Triggers FROM Architect:
           * implementation_needed
           * code_modification_needed
           * refactoring_required

        2. Test Mode Partnership:
           - Implement test requirements
           - Fix test failures
           - Update affected tests
           - Maintain test coverage
           Handoff Triggers TO Test:
           * tests_need_update
           * coverage_check_needed
           * feature_ready_for_testing
           Handoff Triggers FROM Test:
           * test_fixes_required
           * coverage_gaps_found
           * validation_failed

        3. Debug Mode Support:
           - Implement fixes
           - Update error handling
           - Apply performance fixes
           - Document changes
           Handoff Triggers TO Debug:
           * error_investigation_needed
           * performance_issue_found
           * system_analysis_required
           Handoff Triggers FROM Debug:
           * fix_implementation_ready
           * performance_fix_needed
           * error_pattern_found

        4. Ask Mode Interaction:
           - Explain implementations
           - Document code changes
           - Clarify patterns
           - Share knowledge
           Handoff Triggers TO Ask:
           * documentation_needed
           * implementation_explanation
           * pattern_documentation
           Handoff Triggers FROM Ask:
           * clarification_received
           * documentation_complete
           * knowledge_shared
